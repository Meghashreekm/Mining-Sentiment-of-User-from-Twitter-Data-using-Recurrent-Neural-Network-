# Mining-Sentiment-of-User-from-Twitter-Data-using-Recurrent-Neural-Network


* Environment Setup:

* Google Colab:
    To start working with Colab you first need to log in to your google account, then go to this link https://colab.research.google.com.

* Procedure for running code in colab:
* Opening Jupyter Notebook:
   On opening the website you will see a pop-up containing following tabs â€“
   EXAMPLES: Contain a number of Jupyter notebooks of various examples.
   RECENT: Jupyter notebook you have recently worked with.
   GOOGLE DRIVE: Jupyter notebook in your google drive.
   GITHUB: You can add Jupyter notebook from your GitHub but you first need to connect Colab with GitHub.
   UPLOAD: Upload from your local directory.

   Else you can create a new Jupyter notebook by clicking New Python3 Notebook or New Python2 Notebook at the bottom right corner.
   
 Create a new notebook, it will create a Jupyter notebook with Untitled0.ipynb and save it to your google drive in a folder named Colab    Notebooks. Run the code in colab.
 The dataset is stored in google drive connect that drive to google colab upload to it your project folder in google colab in following     way:
  Upon running the second cell of SentimentAnalysisusingLSTM.ipynb file the output provided the link .
  Follow the link to get the security code 
  Copy the same and paste it in the google colab running project and hit enter.
  
* GUI :
  The later part of code consists a small gui  made with ipywidgets library. 
Upon running that cell number 29, the output displays a gui asking the user to enter his emotion or a feeling, enter it and hit submit button to find whether user has depressive symptoms or not
